# Launchpad

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/overtone.device.launchpad.png)](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/overtone.device.launchpad)

Experimenting with ways of interacting a Launchpad with Overtone and Clojure.

![Launchpad S](http://s10.postimg.org/mj3szi1i1/launchpad_s.jpg)

## Usage

Currently left, right, up and down select different states each of which has its own grid.
Grid buttons simply toggle on/off.

```clojure
(use 'launchpad.core)

(boot!)
```

## Todos

Sooo many things to do. Contribute, ideas and code.
