# Launchpad

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/overtone.device.launchpad.png)](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/overtone.device.launchpad)

Experimenting with ways of interacting a Launchpad with Overtone and Clojure.

![Launchpad S](http://s10.postimg.org/mj3szi1i1/launchpad_s.jpg)

## Goal

Provide defaults to get you moving quickly and start exploring while providing the scope later to completely customising the launchpad to your musical desires.

Support for interacting with intelligent machines. One day.

## Clojars

Adding Launchpad as a dependency in your project:

https://clojars.org/launchpad

## Usage

While you can change and do whatever you want `launchpad.core` setups some useful defaults:

* All top control buttons except user1/2
  * Enter mode where each grid remembers keys pressed.
  * Grid buttons simply toggle state/light on/off.
* user1 & user2:
  * Enter mode where there is no persistent grid state.
  * Grid buttons trigger led/fn key-down and off with key-up

### Raw

```clojure
(use 'overtone.live)
(use 'overtone.inst.drum)
(use 'launchpad.core)

(boot!)

(bind :up   :0x0 #(kick))
(bind :down :0x0 #(hat3))
```

### Complex Examples

* Expressing drum/sample positions using LEDS (automatically synching to the beat). 
* Adding a metronome cell which flashes with beat
* Mapping sample to a row, each button forces a jump to a timepoint (like MLR)
